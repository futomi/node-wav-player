node-wav-player
===============

The node-wav-player is a Node.js module which allows you to play a wav file on the host computer. It supports Windows 10, MacOS X, and some Linux distros.

This module can plays a wav file on:

* Windows
  * A wav file is played using [SoundPlayer Class of .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.media.soundplayer.aspx) through PowerShell. This module was tested on Windows 10.
* Mac OS X
  * A wav file is played using `afplay` command.
* Linux
  * A wav file is played using [Alsa `aplay`](https://alsa.opensrc.org/Aplay) command. This module was tested on:
    * [Ubuntu Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop)
    * [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/)
    * [Raspbian Strech with Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
* FreeBSD and DragonflyBSD
  * Just like under Linux you can use ALSA's `aplay` which is in the `alsa-utils` compatibility package

Basically you don't have to install any additional libraries in most environments.

Though this module is intended to play a wav file, it probably can play some audio formats. That depends on the OS. For example, a mp3 file could be played on Mac OS X. But at least on Windows, the supported audio format is only wav.

## Dependencies

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 4 +
  * Though the node-wav-player works on Node 4 for now, it is strongly recommended to use Node 6 or newer. The node-wav-player will not support Node 4 in the future.

## Installation

```
$ cd ~
$ npm install node-wav-player
```

## <a id="Quick-Start">Quick Start</a>

The code blow plays a wav file:

```JavaScript
const player = require('node-wav-player');
player.play({
  path: './speech.wav',
}).then(() => {
  console.log('The wav file started to be played successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

That's it. If this code is run successfully, you will hear the audio from your computer. 

---------------------------------------
## <a id="WavPlayer-object">`WavPlayer` object</a>

In order to use the node-wav-player, you have to load the node-wav-player module as follows:

```JavaScript
const player = require('node-wav-player');
```

In the code snippet above, the variable `player` is a `WavPlayer` object. The `WavPlayer` object has methods as described in sections below.

### <a id="WavPlayer-play-method">play() method</a>

The `play()` method plays a wav file specified to the `path` parameter. This method returns a `Promise` object.

This method takes a hash object containing the properties as follows:

Property | Type    | Required | Description
:--------|:--------|:---------|:-------------------------
`path`   | String  | Required | Path of a wav file (e.g., `"./speech.wav"`)
`loop`   | Boolean | Optional | If `true`, the wave file will be played repeatedly until the [`stop()`](#WavPlayer-stop-method") method is called. The default value is `false`.
`sync`   | Boolean | Optional | If `true`, this method calls the `resove()` after finishing to play the wav file. Otherwise, if `false`, this method calles the `resolve()` immediately after starting to play the wav file. The default value is `false`. If the `loop` is set to `true`, this parameter is ignored (i.e., this parameter is set to the default value `false` ).

If you want to wait for the end of the audio, you can set the `sync` to `true` as follows:

```JavaScript
const player = require('node-wav-player');
player.play({
  path: './speech.wav',
  sync: true
}).then(() => {
  console.log('The wav file was played through.');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});
```

### <a id="WavPlayer-stop-method">stop() method</a>

The `stop()` method stops playing the wav file. This method returns nothing. Note that this method is *not* asynchronous but synchronous.

The code blow starts to play a wav file. Then it stops playing the wav file in 1 second.

```JavaScript
const player = require('node-wav-player');
player.play({
  path: './speech.wav',
}).then(() => {
  console.log('The wav file started to be played successfully.');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
});

setTimeout(() => {
  player.stop();
  console.log('Stopped.')
}, 1000);
```
